# To Do Lists App

A To Do List app in which multiple lists can be created. Each list can renamed or deleted. 

The items in each list can be checked/unchecked, edited or deleted. The list is split into outstanding items and completed items, based on whether or not an item has been checked. All of the items on a list can be deleted, as well as just the completed items.

The app has a dark mode option which can be toggled on or off. 

The lists are saved to local storage. I appreciate that this is not a secure way to store data, and ideally this would be saved to a back-end with a user account, however this is beyond the scope of this front-end project.  

## Issues I Encountered

It was challenging to make this layout fully responsive across different screen sizes. It is also one of the only projects I have done where I created the CSS for desktop first. I had to find a way for the list of to do list names to fit neatly on a mobile screen (without having to scroll too far down to view the actual list), which I achieved by adding a drop-down menu. I also had issues of the layout becoming to squished on smaller screens, so I added CSS to handle text overflow, and reduced the width of the item names on smaller screens.

I also had issues with the soft keyboard on Android devices. When the keyboard was opened to input text, the entire layout became squished, and buttons and text overflowed their containers. I eventually solved this by setting the overflow of the containers to hidden, which not only prevented the contents from overflowing, but also seemed to stop the container itself from being resized.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
